# Active CSS syntax highlighting extension for VSCode.

This is a work-in-progress. It's pretty basic but should help you avoid basic syntax errors.

To install, work out where your .vscode extensions directory is and copy the _whole_ repo (including the directory) into there.

On Windows, the directory should look something like this:

```
c:/Users/yourname/.vscode/extensions/
```

On other operating systems you'll need to look up where the vscode extensions should go by using a search engine.

After copying the extension into that directory, close and restart VSCode.

It should syntax highlight the ".acss" files.
